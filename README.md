## Building

This plugin uses NMS, so if you want to build this project on your local machine, you're going to need to use Spigot BuildTools to build NMS into your .m2 directory.

https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/buildtools/

Run BuildTools. Select version 1.8.8, and in "Options", select "Generate Remapped Jars".

Once you've done that you should be able to build with Maven normally.
